# Maketour
Hello and welcome!  This repository is aimed at providing simple and
easy concrete examples of the various features of Make and how to use
them.  The lessons here are organized in increasing order of 
complexity and each Makefile is documented with what its doing and 
how it works.

I made this tour of Make as a solo project to share with my personal
colleagues but figured the lessons here may help others come to terms
with how this tool functions.  I am completely self taught in Make and
by no means an expert; any style or opinion found here were what I 
found worked for me and are not representative of any large trends.

Please enjoy this repo and feel free to create issues for anything 
you think should be updated!

## How to use this repo
`cd` to the lesson of your choice and follow along with the comments in the Makefile.
I used `GNU Make 4.2.1` for this project.  Please make sure this is the version you
used before creating issues for misbehaving lessons.
